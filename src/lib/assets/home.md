# About Me

I'm a software engineer with a master's degree in ICT and a
co-founder of a software development company called [Kvanttori Oy](https://kvanttori.fi/).

I'm mainly interested in low level languages such as C and Rust but
I also have extensive experience with technologies such as Typescript,
Javascript, React, Svelte and Python.
